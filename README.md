# zio-utils
A collection of utilities for input/output in C

This library relies in WINAPI and MINGW, so it is currently only possible to build using MINGW (or maybe some other POSIX building tools for Windows, although I haven't tried that).

# Building:
'make all' sholud do the job

'make clean' removes the mess ;)
